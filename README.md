## Machine Learning from Arduino Accelerometer

In this project, we calculate acceleration using an accelerometer.  We will construct a device that uses an integrated accelerometer to transmit and store acceleration data as a means to measure the success of the device. We will learn data analytics skills to make sense of their data, then build and train a machine learning model to predict future successes of the device.
	
 ## Future Improvements
  
This project serves as an introduction to signal processing and machine learning, designed for use by K-12 students. I am actively working to increase the usability of this project in the following ways

  - Data Preprocessing to reduce accelerometer noise from the dataset
      
  - Work within Tensorflow to apply Neural Network models to better classify time series data
